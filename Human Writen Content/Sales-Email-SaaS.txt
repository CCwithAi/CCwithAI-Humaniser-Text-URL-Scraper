Hey Sarah,

Quick question.

Are you still manually tracking every customer touchpoint in spreadsheets? Because I just watched our demo team spend 47 minutes updating a single client file yesterday. That's...a lot.

Look, I'm not going to give you the usual pitch about "revolutionary" or "game-changing" stuff. You've heard that before. What I will tell you is this: we built this CRM because we were drowning in our own data chaos, and apparently 3,000+ other teams had the same problem.

Here's what actually matters - you can:
- See every customer interaction in one place (emails, calls, meetings - all of it)
- Stop asking "wait, did someone already talk to them?"
- Actually know which leads are worth your time

The setup takes like 20 minutes. No joke. We had a customer go live during their lunch break.

Want to see it? I can show you Thursday at 2pm, or Friday morning works too. Either way, it'll take 15 minutes and you'll know if it's worth your time.

No pressure. If it's not a fit, totally cool.

Mike

P.S. - We're running a thing where first 50 sign-ups get 3 months at 40% off. Ends Friday. Just saying.
