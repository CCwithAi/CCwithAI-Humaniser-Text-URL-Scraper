This isn't your office coffee.

You know that burnt, bitter taste you've gotten used to? Yeah, we're not doing that. This is what coffee actually tastes like when someone gives a damn.

Single-origin beans from a small farm in Ethiopia. Hand-roasted every Tuesday in Sheffield by Dave, who's annoyingly picky about everything. Medium roast because we're not trying to hide bad beans under char.

Notes of chocolate, berry, a hint of citrus. Smooth finish. Zero bitterness because it's roasted right.

Perfect for your morning routine when you need real coffee, not motor oil. Works in French press, pour-over, or your fancy espresso machine. Whatever you've got.

250g bag. Roasted fresh. Ships same day if you order before 2pm.

£12.99

Your mornings deserve better than whatever you're drinking now. This is it.

Order before midnight Sunday - free delivery, no minimum.

P.S. If you hate it (you won't), we'll refund you. No questions, no hassle. But honestly, you're going to order another bag before the first one runs out.
