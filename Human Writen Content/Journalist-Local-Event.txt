The queue stretched round the corner by 7am.

Leeds city centre's newest bakery, Flour & Fire, opened Saturday to crowds that owner Sarah Chen definitely wasn't expecting. She'd ordered enough pastries for maybe 200 people. By 9am, she'd served 400 and was frantically calling suppliers.

"I thought we'd get a trickle," Chen laughed, flour still dusted across her apron at noon. "This is insane."

The hype started on TikTok, naturally. Food blogger @LeedsEats posted a video of Chen's cinnamon buns that got 2.3 million views in four days. Suddenly everyone wanted one.

Fair enough - they're massive. And according to everyone in that queue, absolutely worth the wait.

"Best thing I've eaten in months," said Jake Morrison, who drove from York specifically for this. He bought six buns. Regretted nothing.

Chen trained in Paris for three years before returning home to Leeds last year. She'd been planning this bakery for months, saved every penny, quit her finance job. Classic leap-of-faith stuff.

The gamble paid off.

By Saturday afternoon, she'd sold out completely. Not a single croissant left. People were disappointed but not surprised - the Instagram photos had been relentless all week. Chen promised to double production for next weekend.

Local business owners are watching closely. Kirkgate Market's seen declining footfall for years. One viral bakery won't reverse that trend, but it's a start. Chen's planning to stay open seven days a week once she stabilises supply.

"People want real food made properly," she said, already prepping Sunday's batches at 6pm Saturday. "Not mass-produced rubbish. Just good bread, good pastries, made with care."

Simple philosophy. Clearly works.

The queue will probably be there again next weekend.
