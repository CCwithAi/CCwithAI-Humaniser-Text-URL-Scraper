The Australian mining giant BHP has made a fresh takeover bid for Anglo American in an attempt to gatecrash its $53bn (£41bn) merger with a Canadian rival.

BHP is said to have renewed its pursuit of the UK-listed company in recent days after abandoning a $49bn takeover offer last year.

It comes after Anglo American struck a deal to join forces with the Canadian miner Teck Resources in a merger of equals, which will rank among the biggest ever in the mining industry if approved.

Shareholders in Anglo and Teck are due to vote on the deal next month and the companies also need to secure regulatory approval in China, the US and Canada.

Despite Anglo and Teck’s insistence that the deal will benefit from the merger of their neighbouring copper mines in Chile, the Canadian government is pushing for more evidence that a tie-up will benefit the North American country.

If a new deal between BHP and Anglo American were pursued, the London firm would be forced to pay a $330m break fee to Teck, as outlined in the merger agreement terms with the Canadian company.

Talks between Anglo and BHP are ongoing, Bloomberg reported, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached.

Anglo American’s share price has jumped by almost a third over the past year as it pursues a fire sale of assets to allow it to focus on its copper and iron ore businesses. It is also preparing to offload its De Beers diamonds division, which once controlled 90pc of the diamonds market.

BHP’s shares have remained flat over the same period.

BHP walked away from a bid to buy Anglo American in May last year following a six-week pursuit. Both sides failed to strike a deal owing to differences over whether the complex takeover plan was too risky to complete.

Anglo American declined to comment. BHP was approached for comment.
